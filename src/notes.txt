Last Update: 3/11/25
New Classes: CollisionComponent, CollisionSystem
Updated Classes: TransformNode, StaticScene 

Implementation Notes
1) New Collision system added. Specific CollisionComponents are part of the CollisionSystem.

TODO:
1) More game-specific collision responses
2) Click on screen and transform screen position to world position to print world coordinates to console (need this so we can define the collision boundaries on our map)
3) Need a way to store multiple collision components in one transform node (for map boundaries)?
