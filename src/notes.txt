Last Update: 3/4/25
New Classes: Animation, Animator
Updated Classes: TextureNode, GeometryNode, GameManager, StaticScene

Implementation Notes
1) New Animator class was initially inspired by Unity's "Animator" component. 
2) TextureNode has been extended to include support for sprite sheets. Earlier in the semester, I had rudimentary sprite sheet support, but this refactor adds more comprehensive support. Texture nodes now contain an Animator object, which is an optional data member that allows for texture-specific animation configurations. Functions were also added for configuring sprite sheets based on individual frame data. There is also a more automated function for generating sprite sheet frame data when sprite sheets have consistent frame dimensions (define_grid()).
3) GeometryNode has been updated to accommodate either full-sized textures or sprite sheets.
4) GameManager has been updated to enforce 60fps-based delta values when actual deltas are below a defined threshold. I imagine this may present problems in the future, but my delta values were so low that my animation system was not synchronizing and this strictly defined timing did resolve the issue.


TODO before next deliverable is complete:
- Follow camera
- NPC pathing
