Implementation Notes

1) Corrected timing issue within TimeManager class by refactoring the class to not hold state information. This class now simply provides a singleton interface for accessing a high resolution clock. 
2) Added a line in TextureNode's init() function to perform nearest neighbor scaling on textures to prevent distortion when scaling up pixel art
3) Removed all of my naive sprite sheet source rectangle and rotation code. I figure it was a nice idea but a bad approach. I'll revisit those ideas as we get to them in class.
4) Added TransformNode hierarchy to static scene. A sphere texture sits at the top with two children that are positioned relative to the parent. This one took some time to wrap my head around when doing child transforms.
